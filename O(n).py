#Implement a Python function called print_items.
#This function should take a single integer as an argument and print out a sequence of numbers from 0 up to, but not including, the provided integer.
#The function should use a for loop and Python's built-in range function to generate the sequence of numbers.
#The function signature should be: def print_items(n):

def print_items(n):  # print_items accepts one argument 'n'. It will print a sequence of numbers from 0 up to, but not including, 'n'.
    for i in range(n):
        print(i)

print_items(10)

#Output
# 0
# 1 
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
